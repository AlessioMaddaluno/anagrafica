# Anagrafica

Anagrafica is a demo-sandbox project used by me to learn the Spring Boot + Angular stack for improving myself as a (wannabe) fullstack developer. It has not a real purpose or even a real sense in terms of funcionality. At the moment consists of:

 - A Spring Boot backend with a JWT Authentication System using a MySQL database used on a Apache Tomcat 9 (in order to learn a bit about Servlet Containers , JNDI and so on);
 - An Angular2+ frontend using Material Design components and Bootstrap 5;
